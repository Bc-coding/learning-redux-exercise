Store --> UI --->  Actions --->  Reducer ---> Store again in cycle

store == state in the concept of redux

How we update our store is by dispatching an action
e.g  dispatch an add_to_cart action

Reducer is a function that takes in two arguments, state and action
Reducer doesn't mutate state directly. We always should return a new state from reducer in reducer we are going to handle

CREATE STORE:
we need 3 things to create store
1. create function from redux
2. a variabel which will hold the value 
3. reduce their function
